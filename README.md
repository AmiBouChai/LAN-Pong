Multiplayer pong played over LAN

How to play:

You either challenge or wait to be challenged. 
If you want to challenge someone else make sure they are already waiting to be challenged and then
enter the local IP address of their computer. If the challenged and challenger are running the app
on the same computer then you can use localhost (127.0.0.1) for challenging the person waiting.
